# Shoppies Project

This project was created for the Shopify Challenge for Front-end Development. 

Shoppies is a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
